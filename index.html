                                and is maybe even more impressive because this is even less expected from a magic show. Brown's

                                to me than the parallel murder mystery--Owens is a clear nature expert with a

                                one has taken my recommendation to read it yet because all I can tell them is that it's
                                about <strong>trees</strong>. But it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/books/review/overstory-richard-powers.html" target="_blank">about trees</a>. And a handful of humans' relationships
                                to trees. And each other. The thoughtfulness behind the entire book, it's commentary on
                                climate change and the environment, and how everything comes together in the end is incredible.
